Traits / Probability Design Goals:


• Store everything in decimal form (0.0-1.0). Users on both ends (writer, dev)
will be able to set upper and lower bounds to whatever they want. That way
the writer doesn't need to know how the devs are scaling their traits
and vice versa.

List Item Trait info
• lower bound decimal
• upper bound decimal
• Probability while in range




How should list items with assigned traits compare to regular?

Example:

Hey \S[player], \L[testList]

testList:
==========
general: 0.3 : what are you doing today?
linked -> attraction, L0.3H0.7P:0.5 um, give me a call if you'd like to hang out sometime
linked -> attraction, L0.7H1.0P:0.7 let me know when we can hang out =)
linked -> jealousy, L0.3H0.7P0.5  Oh, going out to see \S[rival] now are we?
